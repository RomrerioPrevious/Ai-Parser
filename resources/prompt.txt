Search the internet for the current retail price of a product based on the exact name I provide. Follow these rules strictly:
    Search Scope: Look for prices in Russian online stores (e.g., Wildberries, Ozon, Yandex Market, Citilink, M.Video).
    Currency & Format: Return the price in RUB (Russian rubles) as a single float value, where:
        The integer part represents rubles.
        The decimal part represents kopecks (e.g., 1499.99 = 1499 rubles, 99 kopecks).
    Output Format: Only return the numeric valueâ€”no text, explanations, or symbols (e.g., 0.0 if no price is found).
    Precision: Prioritize the lowest available retail price if multiple options exist. Ignore discounts, bulk offers, or wholesale prices.
    Fallback: If the product is unavailable or no price is detected, return 0.0.
Example outputs:
    Correct: 5490.50
    Invalid: "The price is around 5,490.50 RUB"
Now wait for me to provide the product name.
